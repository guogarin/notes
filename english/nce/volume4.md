&emsp;&emsp; 换句话说，practice/practise在英式英语中前者为名词，后者为动词，而美式英语中不论动词名词都是practice（即在美式英语中，practice = practice(英式) + practise(英式)）

# Lesson 13 The Search for Oil 探寻石油
&emsp;&emsp; 选自科普作家 `T. F. Gaskell` 所著 `The Search for the Earth’s Minerals from Discovery`

## 1. `as many as` 和 `‌as much as` 
### (1) `as many as`
`as many as` 可以看成是 `as many… as`的一种变体。 `as many … as` 是用来进行**同等数量**的比较。 例如:
> I have as many friends as you have.
> 我的朋友和你的一样多。
> 
当`as many as`作为一个整体用时,则意思是“多达……”它总是与一个带有数词的复数名词连用。例如:
> I have as many as five hundred books.
> 我的书多达500本。
> 
`as many` 是来源于 `as many … as`。 `as many` 总是用在那种在上文中已出现过有明确数词的句子里。例如:
> He made three mistakes in as many sentences。(注意: as many(sentences)之前已出现 > three(mistakes)这个数词,这就说明sentences和mistakes是同等数量。
> 他在三个句子中就出了三个错。
> 
### (2) `‌as much as`
`as much … as`, `as much`和 `as many…as`与`as many`用法基本相同，只是前者都用于**不可数名词**。例如:
> This bottle contains as much ink as that one.
> 这瓶子装的墨水和那瓶子装的一样多。
> 
> Don't thank me; I would do as much for anyone[意即:I would do as much for anyone as I did for you.]
> 不用谢我，我对任何人都会那样做。
> 
和`as many as`一样，`as much as`也可以表示 `...之多`，例如:
> The book cost me as much as twenty yuan
> 那本书花了我二十元之多。
> 
此外，`as much as`还可用作状语，表示 “等于”、“几乎是”,意义与`as good as`相近。例如:
> By running away he as much as admitted that he had taken the money.
> 他的逃跑等于承认他拿了钱。
> 
`as much as`的另一种用法是作词组引导一个让步状语从句，表示 “虽然”“尽管”，这时它与muchas没有区别。例如：
> I must stay home and study tonight,(as) much as I hate to do it.
> 尽管我不喜欢，今晚我仍必须留在家里读书。
>

# Lesson 16 The Modern City 现代都市
&emsp;&emsp; 选自法国生物学家、优生学家 `Alexis Carrel (1873-1944)`所著 `Man, the Unknown, 1935`，作者于 1912 年因在血管缝合以及血管和器官移植研究上的工作(`for his work on vascular suture and the transplantation of blood vessels and organs`)荣获诺贝尔生理学或医学奖. 本文选自原著第一章`The need of a better knowledge of man` 第 3 节.
## 1. physiological 和 mental
&emsp;&emsp; 尽管英文 psychological 和 mental 在词典释义上有差别，但你问的这两个词组则指的是同一件事。
&emsp;&emsp; `mental health` 是生活中通常用来指“心理健康”和医学意义上的“精神方面健康”。比如 `He is mentally strong/healthy.` 意思是他有健康的生活意识，意志坚强等。而 `He is mentally ill` 则可能指他有精神疾病。
&emsp;&emsp; `psychological health` 是心理医学名词，也包括上面的内容，但生活中却不常用。人们听到这个词时会有“咬文嚼字”的感觉。但它传递的信息和 `mental health` 并没有什么不同。正式文件里这个词组出现的机率恐怕会高一些。

> 电影还要一个小时才开场，我们不妨去喝杯咖啡。
