&emsp;&emsp; 在讨论这三大从句的简化时， 我们把从句与非谓语结合起来讨论， 以便让读者用一个全新的视角来看待从句和非谓语之间的关系， 这样才不至于把它们各自孤立和割裂开来， 造成僵化理解， 从而真正达到融会贯通、 灵活运用的境界。

# 1.  名词从句的简化
&emsp;&emsp; 我们知道， 名词从句是属于名词性的， 而英文中的三大非谓语只有动名词和不定式具有名词的特征，可以当成名词来使用。 因此， 属于名词类的名词从句自然能被简化成两种形式——动名词和不定式。

## 1.1 名词从句与动名词
&emsp;&emsp; 在第一章“名词从句”中我们讲过， 四大类名词从句（即主语从句、 宾语从句、 表语从句和同位语从句） 主要是由三种句子转化过来的， 即陈述句、 一般疑问句和特殊疑问句。 但这三种句子不能直接作句子成分， 需要经过一些结构上的变化。 比如， 陈述句转化为名词从句时要用连词that引导； 一般疑问句转化为名词从句时要用if或whether来引导； 特殊疑问句转化为名词从句时不需要另外添加连词， 只需保留特殊疑问词（如what或who） 即可。 现在的结论是： 由陈述句变来的， 即由that引导的名词从句一般简化成动名词来表达， 通常采用动名词复合结构的形式； 由疑问句变来的， 即由whether或what等引导的名词从句一般简化为不定式。
&emsp;&emsp; 下面我们就举例说明that引导的名词从句与动名词之间的相关性。
### 一、 that引导的主语从句与动名词
直接用动名词的复合结构来替换主语从句， 放在句首作主语。 请比较：
> 1 
> 1）It surprised us that John won the marathon.
> 2）That John won the marathon surprised us.
> 3）John's winning the marathon surprised us.
> 
> 约翰赢得了马拉松比赛， 这真让我们吃惊。
> 
&emsp;&emsp; 在例句1） 中， it是形式主语， 真正的主语是that引导的从句John won the marathon， 被后置了。 
&emsp;&emsp; 在例句2） 中， that引导的从句John won the marathon作主语， 谓语是surprised。 
&emsp;&emsp; 在例句3） 中， 由例句2） 中的主语从句John won the marathon变为动名词的复合结构John's winning the marathon来充当句子的主语。


请再比较：
> 2 
> 1） That he lost the game came as a surprise to everybody.
> 2） His losing the game came as a surprise to everybody.
> 他在比赛中失利， 这让每个人都觉得很意外。
> 
&emsp;&emsp; 在例句1） 中， that引导的主语从句that he lost the game作主语， 谓语是came。 
&emsp;&emsp; 在例句2）中， 由例句1） 中的主语从句that he lost the game变为动名词的复合结构his losing the game来充当句子的主语。

### 二、 that引导的同位语从句与动名词
&emsp;&emsp; 简化that引导的同位语从句时， 也是变同位语从句为一个动名词的复合结构。 但是， 因为英文中没有“名词+动名词”这样的结构， 所以要在同位语从句修饰的名词后面加上一个介词， 来连接名词与动名词，同时表达同位语关系。 能担当此任的介词通常是of， 偶尔可以用about等。 于是句子由原来的同位语从句结构“名词+that同位语从句”变成了一个动名词结构“名词+of+动名词的复合结构”。 请比较：
3 1) There was no chance that Davy would come from the battle alive.
1) There was no chance of Davy coming from the battle alive.
妙语点睛 在例句1） 中， that引导的同位语从句Davy would come from the battle alive补充说明先行词
chance， 以表明chance的具体内容。 在例句2） 中， 由例句1） 中的同位语从句that Davy would come from the
battle alive变为动名词的复合结构Davy coming from the battle alive， 放在介词of后面， 来补充说明chance。
这里的of表示同位说明关系。

再请比较：
4 1) We were greatly encouraged by the news that China had launched another man-made satellite.
1) We were greatly encouraged by the news of China having launched another man-made satellite.
妙语点睛 在例句1） 中， that引导的同位语从句China had launched another man-made satellite补充说明
先行词news， 以表明news的具体内容。 在例句2） 中， 由例句1） 中的同位语从句China had launched another
man-made satellite变为动名词的复合结构China having launched another man-made satellite， 放在介词of后
面， 来补充说明news。 这里的of表示同位说明关系。
精品译文 听到中国又发射了一颗人造卫星的消息， 我们都受到极大的鼓舞。
再请比较：
5 1) Anyone with half an eye on the unemployment figures knew that the assertion that economic recovery
would be just around the corner was untrue.
1) Anyone with half an eye on the unemployment figures knew that the assertion about economic
recovery being just around the corner was untrue.
妙语点睛 在例句1） 中， that引导的同位语从句economic recovery would be just around the corner补充
说明先行词assertion， 以表明assertion的具体内容。 在例句2） 中， 由例句1） 中的同位语从句 economic
recovery would be just around the corner变为动名词的复合结构economic recovery being just around the corner，
放在介词about后面， 来补充说明assertion。 这里的about表示同位说明关系。

实的。

### 三、 that引导的宾语从句与动名词
&emsp;&emsp; 由that引导的宾语从句的简化较为复杂， 因为它可以转换成动名词， 也可以转换成不定式， 这主要与主句谓语动词的用法密切相关。 请比较：
> 6 
> 1） I consider that I will emigrate to America in the future.
> 2） I consider emigrating to America in the future.
> 
> 我在考虑将来移民到美国。
> 
&emsp;&emsp; 在例句1） 中， that引导的宾语从句I will emigrate to America in the future充当动词consider的宾语。 
&emsp;&emsp; 在例句2） 中， 由例句1） 中的宾语从句I will emigrate to America in the future变为动名词emigrating toAmerica in the future。 这是因为consider的后面要接动名词， 不能接不定式， 因此该从句要简化为动名词。

有的主句的谓语动词后面还需添加一个介词， 然后才能接动名词作宾语。 例如：
> 7 
> 1）Jane's mother insisted that she should go swimming with her brother.
> 2）Jane's mother insisted on her going swimming with her brother.
> 
> 简的妈妈坚持要求她和她哥哥一起去游泳。
> 
&emsp;&emsp; 在例句1） 中， that引导的宾语从句she should go swimming with her brother充当动词insisted的宾语。 
&emsp;&emsp; 在例句2） 中， 由例句1） 中的宾语从句she should go swimming with her brother变为动名词的复合结构her going swimming with her brother， 并且之前还添加了介词on， 这是因为insist的后面要接介词on之后才能接宾语。

&emsp;&emsp; 同理类推， 对于那些要求接不定式作宾语的动词， 其后的that引导的宾语从句简化后只能是不定式。 比如：
> 8 
> 1）I hope that I can drive to work in my own car.
> 2）I hope to drive to work in my own car.
> 
> 我希望能够开着自己的车去上班。
> 
&emsp;&emsp; 在例句1） 中， that引导的宾语从句I can drive to work in my own car充当动词hope的宾语。
&emsp;&emsp; 在例句2） 中， 由例句1） 中的宾语从句I can drive to work in my own car变为不定式to drive to work in my own car， 这是因为hope的后面要接不定式， 不能接动名词， 因此该从句要简化为不定式。

&emsp;&emsp; 综上所述， 宾语从句是简化成动名词还是不定式形式， 完全取决于主句的谓语动词。 因此， 要求我们对动词的用法比较熟悉， 我们在前面各章节中已经分别列举过接动名词或不定式作宾语的动词。

### 思维总结
&emsp;&emsp; 本节主要讨论了that引导的名词从句与动名词的复合结构之间的关系， 二者可以进行相互转换， 这尤其是针对that引导的主语从句和同位语从句而言。 that引导的宾语从句是简化成动名词还是不定式形式， 完全取决于主句的谓语动词。

## 1.2 名词从句与不定式
&emsp;&emsp; 上文讲过， 由疑问句变来的， 即由whether或what等引导的名词从句一般简化为不定式， 其实主要是宾语从句简化为不定式。 此时的宾语从句中往往含有情态动词， 比较多见的是should或can/could。 请比较：
> 1 
> 1） She can't decide whether she should go with him or stay home.
> 2） She can't decide whether to go with him or（to） stay home.
> 
> 她还没有决定， 应该和他一起去还是就呆在家里。
> 
由whether引导的宾语从句whether she should go with him or stay home变为不定式whether to go with him or stay home， 这里的不定式具有“应该”的情态意义。

再比如：
> 2 
> 1）I haven't decided whether I should vote for Clint.
> 2）I haven't decided whether to vote for Clint.
> 
> 我还没有决定是否应该给克林特投票。
> 
我们再来看两个疑问句的例子：
> 3 
> 1） I don't know what I should do.
> 2） I don't know what to do.
> 我不知道该做什么。
> 
由what引导的宾语从句what I should do变为不定式what to do， 这里的不定式具有“应该”的情态意义。

> 4 
> 1） Please tell me how I can get to the bus station.
> 2） Please tell me how to get to the bus station.
> 请告诉我去汽车站怎么走。
> 
由how引导的宾语从句how I can get to the bus station变为不定式how to get to the bus station，这里的不定式具有“能够”的情态意义。
