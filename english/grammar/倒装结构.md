# 1. 综述
&emsp;&emsp; 倒装在英文中是一种较为常见的语法现象。从结构上来讲，倒装句可分为全部倒装和部分倒装：
> **全部倒装** : 将 整个谓语部分 全部放在主语之前。
> **部分倒装** : 只将 谓语的一部分(例如助动词或系动词)  放在主语之前，其余部分仍然放在主语之后。
>
例如：
> a. Now comes your turn.(全部倒装)
> 
> b. Could you show me that book?(部分倒装)
>

# 3. 部分倒装
## （1）句首有否定词或否定短语时，句子要部分倒装
### 1）常见的否定词有：
> never，hardly，scarcely，little，seldom，not，not until，rarely，no sooner...than，nowhere...
>

> a. &emsp;&emsp; **So scary are those** three words, words spoken in passion, spoken in a whisper. At one precise moment they feel so true so right. Some use them casually in their everyday chatter, but I find them sacred. I can speak them only when I'm certain. I will not use them in vain. They've been spoken to me before under the shroud of darkness beneath a warm touch. But **never before did they** ring true. **Never before did they** grab my heart and caress it with the magic of a pure soul. **Never before have they** been sincere enough to have my lips echo their syllables in the most meaningful sentence I could ever speak. Those three words are only for you.
> 
> b. **Nowhere** in the world **can you** find a man who is more foolish than John.
>
> c. **Nowhere** in the world **can you** find a man who loves you so much!

> 正确答案：D。
> 

### 2）常见的否定词有：
> in no way，in no case，at no time，by no means，in no sense，on no account，under no circumstances等
>
这些否定短语常放在句首，表示强调，意为“绝不......”。大家一定要记住它们规定的介词搭配。

> 
> b.On no account_________rudeness from his employees.

### 3） 如果否定词不是修饰整个句子，而只是限定句子主语，则句子不用倒装

> 
> b.Not only I but also he has been there.
> 
> c.To me he is not dead at all. **Hardly a day** goes by that I don't think of him or speak of him.

> 
> c.To such an extent_________his empty speech that some of us began to doze.
> A. did he go on with
> B. he would go on with
> C. he went on with
> D. he did go on with
> 正确答案：A。
> 

## （3）在含有were, had, should的虚拟语气中，若省去if，必须倒装。（详见虚拟语气”中“非真实条件虚拟语气句”的“倒装虚拟语气句”）

## （4） as引导的让步状语从句必须倒装。（详见“Chapter 3状语从句”中“31让步状语从句”第（5）点“as的倒装句”）

### 2）onlv若加各类状语从句置于句首，需要注意是主句中的主谓语必须倒装，而不是从句中的主谓语倒装，这一点与not until用法相同。
> a. **Only when** he had failed three times **did he** turn to me for advice.
> 
> b. **Only when** a man's life comes to its end in prosperity **dare we** pronounce him happy.
> 只有当一个人的生命在辉煌中结束时，我们才能断言他是幸福的。
> 
> c. An intimate relationship does not banish loneliness. **Only when** we are comfortable with who we are and can function independently in a healthy way, can we truly function within a relationship. Two halves do not make a whole when it comes to a healthy relationship: it takes two wholes.
> 

### 3） 若only修饰的是句子主语，而非状语时，句子不用倒装
> **Only she** knew how to deal with this problem.
>

## （6）代词so, neither, nor或no more置于句首。
