# 2. `barely` 、`hardly` 、 `merely` 和 `scarcely`
`hardly、scarcely 与 barely`这些副词均含 `“几乎不” `之意。
## 2.1 hardly • scarcely • barely • no sooner
**(1) Hardly , scarcely and barely can all be used to say that something is only just true or possible. They are used with words like any and anyone , with adjectives and verbs, and are placed between can , could , have , be , etc. and the main part of the verb.**
`hardly、scarcely和barely`均可指`刚刚、几乎不`，与`any`和`anyone`等词以及形容词和动词连用，置于`can、could、have、be`等与动词的主要部分之间：
> • They have sold scarcely any copies of the book. 这书他们几乎没卖出几本。
> 
> • I barely recognized her. 我几乎认不出她了。
> 
> • His words were barely audible. 他的话勉强听得见。
> 
> • I can hardly believe it. 我几乎不敢相信。
> • ~~I hardly can believe it.~~
> 

**(2) Hardly , scarcely and barely are negative words and should not be used with not or other negatives.**
`hardly、scarcely和barely` 均为否定词，不应与`not`或其他否定词连用：
> •I can hardly believe it. 我几乎不敢相信。
> • ~~I can’t hardly believe it.~~
>

**(3) You can also use hardly , scarcely and barely to say that one thing happens immediately after another.**
亦可用`hardly、scarcely和barely`表示 `刚…就…`：
> • We had hardly/scarcely/barely sat down at the table, when the phone rang. 我们刚在桌子旁坐下，电话铃就响了。
> 
**In formal, written English, especially in a literary style, these words can be placed at the beginning of the sentence and then the subject and verb are turned around.**
在正式的书面英语中，尤其在文学体中，上述各词可置于句首，然后将主语和动词的位置倒装：
> • Hardly/Scarcely had we sat down at the table, when the phone rang. 我们刚在桌子旁坐下，电话铃就响了。
> 
**Note that you usually use when in these sentences, not than . You can also use before .**
注意：在这类句子中通常用when而非than，亦可用before：
> • I scarcely had time to ring the bell before the door opened. 我刚一按门铃，门就开了。
> 
**No sooner can be used in the same way, but is always used with than .**
`no sooner`与上述词用法相同，但总与than连用：
> • No sooner had we sat down at the table than the phone rang. 我们刚在桌子旁坐下，电话铃就响了。
> 
**(4) Hardly and scarcely can be used to mean ‘almost never’, but barely is not used in this way.**
`hardly和scarcely`可表示几乎从不、难得，但`barely`不这样用：

## 对比
### `Contain` 和 `include`
**`Contain`**
> refers to container. When you use it, you don't have to list all parts.
> Contain是基于容器的概念。是指一个容器里包含某些东西。使用contain时无需列出所有组成部分。
> 
Example:
> The web page should contain a hyper link. (the web page is a container)
> 

**`include`**
> When you use it, you don’t have to list all parts.
> 
Example:
> You should include a link in your answer.
> 
`Include`侧重的是抽象的组成。
**difference between “contain” and “include”**
&emsp;&emsp; The difference between “contain” and “include” is more subtle(微妙的). Imagine there is a box, inside the box, there are only 3 balls (a red one, a yellow one, and a green one). You can say in these ways:
> The box contains a green ball. (the box is a container)
> 
> The contents of the box include a green ball. (the contents are made up of balls)
> 

### `Consist of`, `comprise`, and `compose`
&emsp;&emsp; `Consist of`, com`prise, and `compose` are similar, and not allowed to be used in continuous form (进行时态). ~~be consisting of, be comprising, be composing~~ are wrong in English.
**Consist of**: 
&emsp;&emsp; When you use `Consist of`, you must list all parts(**必须列出所有组成部分~**). Be aware, ~~be consisted of~~ is wrong in English.
> North America consists of three countries: the USA, Canada, and Mexico. (no other countries)
> 
**Comprise**
&emsp;&emsp; `Comprise` is more formal than `consist`. When you it, you must list all parts(**必须列出所有组成部分~**). ~~be comprised of~~ is correct in English.
> A computer comprises CPU, memory, and I/O.
> 
**Compose**
&emsp;&emsp; `Compose` is more formal than `comprise`. It is only used in the passive voice - “be composed of”. When you it, you must list all parts(**必须列出所有组成部分~**).
> A computer is composed of CPU, memory, and I/O.
> 

### 总结
`include`、`contain`都不需要列出所有组成部分，但`Consist of`, `comprise`和 `compose`需要
